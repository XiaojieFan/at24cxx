Notes: 

  1. The exposed pad on this package can be connected to GND or left floating.

  2. If the A0, A1, A2 or WP pins are not driven, they are internally pulled down to GND. In order to operate in a
         wide variety of application environments, the pull-down mechanism is intentionally designed to be somewhat
         strong. Once this pin is biased above the CMOS input buffer’s trip point (~0.5 x VCC), the pull‑down
         mechanism disengages. Microchip recommends connecting this pin to a known state whenever possible.

2.1 Device Address Inputs (A0, A1, A2)

              The A0, A1 and A2 pins are device address inputs that are hard-wired (directly to GND or to VCC) for compatibility
              with other two-wire Serial EEPROM devices. When the pins are hard-wired, as many as eight devices may be
              addressed on a single bus system. A device is selected when a corresponding hardware and software match is true.
              If these pins are left floating, the A0, A1 and A2 pins will be internally pulled down to GND. However, due to
              capacitive coupling that may appear in customer applications, Microchip recommends always connecting the address
              pins to a known state. When using a pull‑up resistor, Microchip recommends using 10 kΩ or less.

2.2 Ground

              The ground reference for the power supply. GND should be connected to the system ground.

2.3 Serial Data (SDA)

              The SDA pin is an open-drain bidirectional input/output pin used to serially transfer data to and from the device. The
              SDA pin must be pulled high using an external pull-up resistor (not to exceed 10 kΩ in value) and may be wire-ORed
              with any number of other open-drain or open-collector pins from other devices on the same bus.

2.4 Serial Clock (SCL)

              The SCL pin is used to provide a clock to the device and to control the flow of data to and from the device. Command
              and input data present on the SDA pin is always latched in on the rising edge of SCL, while output data on the SDA
              pin is clocked out on the falling edge of SCL. The SCL pin must either be forced high when the serial bus is idle or
              pulled high using an external pull-up resistor.

2.5 Write-Protect (WP)

              The write-protect input, when connected to GND, allows normal write operations. When the WP pin is connected
              directly to VCC, all write operations to the protected memory are inhibited.

If the pin is left floating, the WP pin will be internally pulled down to GND. However, due to capacitive coupling that
may appear in customer applications, Microchip recommends always connecting the WP pin to a known state. When
using a pull‑up resistor, Microchip recommends using 10 kΩ or less.

2.6 Device Power Supply (VCC)

              The Device Power Supply (VCC) pin is used to supply the source voltage to the device. Operations at invalid VCC
              voltages may produce spurious results and should not be attempted.

4.5 Electrical Specifications

4.5.1    Power-Up Requirements and Reset Behavior
4.5.1.1  During a power-up sequence, the VCC supplied to the AT24C128C/AT24C256C should monotonically rise from GND
         to the minimum VCC level, as specified in Table 4-1, with a slew rate no faster than 0.1 V/µs.

         Device Reset
         To prevent inadvertent write operations or any other spurious events from occurring during a power-up sequence, the
         AT24C128C/AT24C256C includes a Power-on Reset (POR) circuit. Upon power-up, the device will not respond to
         any commands until the VCC level crosses the internal voltage threshold (VPOR) that brings the device out of Reset
         and into Standby mode.

         The system designer must ensure the instructions are not sent to the device until the VCC supply has reached a
         stable value greater than or equal to the minimum VCC level. Additionally, once the VCC is greater than or equal to the
         minimum VCC level, the bus master must wait at least tPUP before sending the first command to the device. See Table
         4-4 for the values associated with these power-up parameters.

         Note: 
           1. These parameters are characterized but they are not 100% tested in production.

         If an event occurs in the system where the VCC level supplied to the AT24C128C/AT24C256C drops below the
         maximum VPOR level specified, it is recommended that a full power cycle sequence be performed by first driving the
         VCC pin to GND, waiting at least the minimum tPOFF time and then performing a new power-up sequence in
         compliance with the requirements defined in this section.

                                         Device Operation and Communication

5. Device Operation and Communication

              The AT24C128C/AT24C256C operates as a slave device and utilizes a simple I2C-compatible two-wire digital serial
              interface to communicate with a host controller, commonly referred to as the bus master. The master initiates and
              controls all read and write operations to the slave devices on the serial bus, and both the master and the slave
              devices can transmit and receive data on the bus.

              The serial interface is comprised of just two signal lines: Serial Clock (SCL) and Serial Data (SDA). The SCL pin is
              used to receive the clock signal from the master, while the bidirectional SDA pin is used to receive command and
              data information from the master as well as to send data back to the master. Data is always latched into the
              AT24C128C/AT24C256C on the rising edge of SCL and always output from the device on the falling edge of SCL.
              Both the SCL and SDA pins incorporate integrated spike suppression filters and Schmitt Triggers to minimize the
              effects of input spikes and bus noise.

              All command and data information is transferred with the Most Significant bit (MSb) first. During bus communication,
              one data bit is transmitted every clock cycle, and after eight bits (one byte) of data have been transferred, the
              receiving device must respond with either an Acknowledge (ACK) or a No-Acknowledge (NACK) response bit during
              a ninth clock cycle (ACK/NACK clock cycle) generated by the master. Therefore, nine clock cycles are required for
              every one byte of data transferred. There are no unused clock cycles during any read or write operation, so there
              must not be any interruptions or breaks in the data stream during each data byte transfer and ACK or NACK clock
              cycle.

              During data transfers, data on the SDA pin must only change while SCL is low, and the data must remain stable while
              SCL is high. If data on the SDA pin changes while SCL is high, then either a Start or a Stop condition will occur. Start
              and Stop conditions are used to initiate and end all serial bus communication between the master and the slave
              devices. The number of data bytes transferred between a Start and a Stop condition is not limited and is determined
              by the master. In order for the serial bus to be idle, both the SCL and SDA pins must be in the logic high state at the
              same time.

5.1 Clock and Data Transition Requirements

              The SDA pin is an open-drain terminal and therefore must be pulled high with an external pull‑up resistor. SCL is an
              input pin that can either be driven high or pulled high using an external pull‑up resistor. Data on the SDA pin may
              change only during SCL low time periods. Data changes during SCL high periods will indicate a Start or Stop
              condition as defined below. The relationship of the AC timing parameters with respect to SCL and SDA for the
              AT24C128C/AT24C256C are shown in the timing waveform in Figure 4-1. The AC timing characteristics and
              specifications are outlined in AC Characteristics.

5.2    Start and Stop Conditions

5.2.1  Start Condition
       A Start condition occurs when there is a high-to-low transition on the SDA pin while the SCL pin is at a stable logic ‘1’
5.2.2  state and will bring the device out of Standby mode. The master uses a Start condition to initiate any data transfer
       sequence; therefore, every command must begin with a Start condition. The device will continuously monitor the SDA
       and SCL pins for a Start condition but will not respond unless one is detected. Refer to Figure 5-1 for more details.

       Stop Condition
       A Stop condition occurs when there is a low-to-high transition on the SDA pin while the SCL pin is stable in the logic
       ‘1’ state.

       The master can use the Stop condition to end a data transfer sequence with the AT24C128C/AT24C256C, which will
       subsequently return to Standby mode. The master can also utilize a repeated Start condition instead of a Stop
       condition to end the current data transfer if the master will perform another operation. Refer to Figure 5-1 for more
       details.

                                               Device Operation and Communication

5.3 Acknowledge and No-Acknowledge

              After every byte of data is received, the receiving device must confirm to the transmitting device that it has
              successfully received the data byte by responding with what is known as an Acknowledge (ACK).
              An ACK is accomplished by the transmitting device first releasing the SDA line at the falling edge of the eighth clock
              cycle followed by the receiving device responding with a logic ‘0’ during the entire high period of the ninth clock cycle.

When the AT24C128C/AT24C256C is transmitting data to the master, the master can indicate that it is done receiving
data and wants to end the operation by sending a logic ‘1’ response to the AT24C128C/AT24C256C instead of an
ACK response during the ninth clock cycle. This is known as a No-Acknowledge (NACK) and is accomplished by the
master sending a logic ‘1’ during the ninth clock cycle, at which point the AT24C128C/AT24C256C will release the
SDA line so the master can then generate a Stop condition.

The transmitting device, which can be the bus master or the Serial EEPROM, must release the SDA line at the falling
edge of the eighth clock cycle to allow the receiving device to drive the SDA line to a logic ‘0’ to ACK the previous 8-
bit word. The receiving device must release the SDA line at the end of the ninth clock cycle to allow the transmitter to
continue sending new data. A timing diagram has been provided in Figure 5-1 to better illustrate these requirements.

5.4 Standby Mode

              The AT24C128C/AT24C256C features a low-power Standby mode that is enabled when any one of the following
              occurs:

                • A valid power-up sequence is performed (see Power-Up Requirements and Reset Behavior).
                • A Stop condition is received by the device unless it initiates an internal write cycle (see Write Operations).
                • At the completion of an internal write cycle (see Write Operations).

5.5 Software Reset

              After an interruption in protocol, power loss or system Reset, any two‑wire device can be protocol reset by clocking
              SCL until SDA is released by the EEPROM and goes high. The number of clock cycles until SDA is released by the
              EEPROM will vary. The software Reset sequence should not take more than nine dummy clock cycles. Once the
              software Reset sequence is complete, new protocol can be sent to the device by sending a Start condition followed
              by the protocol. Refer to Figure 5-2 for an illustration.

6. Memory Organization

              The AT24C128C is internally organized as 256 pages of 64 bytes each. The AT24C256C is internally organized as
              512 pages of 64 bytes each.

6.1 Device Addressing

              Accessing the device requires an 8-bit device address byte following a Start condition to enable the device for a read
              or write operation. Since multiple slave devices can reside on the serial bus, each slave device must have its own
              unique address so the master can access each device independently.

              The Most Significant four bits of the device address byte is referred to as the device type identifier. The device type
              identifier ‘1010’ (Ah) is required in bits 7 through 4 of the device address byte (see Table 6‑1).

              Following the 4-bit device type identifier are the hardware slave address bits, A2, A1 and A0. These bits can be used
              to expand the address space by allowing up to eight Serial EEPROM devices on the same bus. These hardware
              slave address bits must correlate with the voltage level on the corresponding hardwired device address input pins A0,
              A1 and A2. The A0, A1 and A2 pins use an internal proprietary circuit that automatically biases the pin to a logic ‘0’
              state if the pin is allowed to float. In order to operate in a wide variety of application environments, the pull‑down
              mechanism is intentionally designed to be somewhat strong. Once the pin is biased above the CMOS input buffer's
              trip point (~0.5 x VCC), the pull‑down mechanism disengages. Microchip recommends connecting the A0, A1 and A2
              pins to a known state whenever possible.

              The eighth bit (bit 0) of the device address byte is the Read/Write Select bit. A read operation is initiated if this bit is
              high and a write operation is initiated if this bit is low.

              Upon the successful comparison of the device address byte, the AT24C128C/AT24C256C will return an ACK. If a
              valid comparison is not made, the device will NACK.

For all operations except the current address read, two 8‑word address bytes must be transmitted to the device
immediately following the device address byte. The word address bytes contains a 14‑bit (in the case of the
AT24C128C) or 15-bit (in the case of the AT24C256C) memory array word address, and are used to specify which
byte location in the EEPROM to start reading or writing. Refer to Table 6-2 to review these bit positions.

The first word address byte contains the six Most Significant bits of the word address (A13 through A8) in bit
positions five through zero (AT24C128C case) or the seven Most Significant bits of the word address (A14 through
A8) in bit positions six through zero (AT24C256C case), as seen in Table 6-2. The remainder of the first word address
byte are “don’t care” bits (in bit positions seven and six for the AT24C128C, in bit position seven for the AT24C256C)
as they are outside of the addressable 128/256 Kbit range. Upon completion of the first word address byte, the
AT24C128C/AT24C256C will return an ACK.

7. Write Operations

              All write operations for the AT24C128C/AT24C256C begin with the master sending a Start condition, followed by a
              device address byte with the R/W bit set to logic ‘0’, and then by the word address byte. The data value(s) to be
              written to the device immediately follow the word address byte.

7.1  Byte Write

     The AT24C128C/AT24C256C supports the writing of a single 8-bit byte. Selecting a data word in the AT24C128C
     requires a 14-bit word address, while selecting a data word in the AT24C256C requires a 15-bit word address.

     Upon receipt of the proper device address and the word address bytes, the EEPROM will send an Acknowledge. The
     device will then be ready to receive the 8-bit data word. Following receipt of the 8‑bit data word, the EEPROM will
     respond with an ACK. The addressing device, such as a bus master, must then terminate the write operation with a
     Stop condition. At that time, the EEPROM will enter an internally self-timed write cycle, which will be completed within
     tWR, while the data word is being programmed into the nonvolatile EEPROM. All inputs are disabled during this write
     cycle, and the EEPROM will not respond until the write is complete.

              address bit.

7.2 Page Write

              A page write operation for the AT24C128C and AT24C256C allows up to 64 bytes to be written in the same write
              cycle, provided all bytes are in the same row of the memory array (where address bits A13/A14 to A6 are the same).
              Partial page writes of less than 64 bytes are also allowed.

              A page write is initiated the same way as a byte write, but the bus master does not send a Stop condition after the
              first data word is clocked in. Instead, after the EEPROM acknowledges receipt of the first data word, the bus master
              can transmit up to 63 additional data words. The EEPROM will respond with an ACK after each data word is
              received. Once all data to be written has been sent to the device, the bus master must issue a Stop condition (see
              Figure 7-2) at which time the internally self-timed write cycle will begin.

              The lower six bits of the word address are internally incremented following the receipt of each data word. The higher
              order address bits are not incremented and retain the memory page row location. Page write operations are limited to
              writing bytes within a single physical page, regardless of the number of bytes actually being written. When the
              incremented word address reaches the page boundary, the address counter will rollover to the beginning of the same

7.3 Acknowledge Polling

              An Acknowledge Polling routine can be implemented to optimize time-sensitive applications that would prefer not to
              wait the fixed maximum write cycle time (tWR). This method allows the application to know immediately when the
              Serial EEPROM write cycle has completed, so a subsequent operation can be started.

              Once the internally self-timed write cycle has started, an Acknowledge Polling routine can be initiated. This involves
              repeatedly sending a Start condition followed by a valid device address byte with the R/W bit set at logic ‘0’. The
              device will not respond with an ACK while the write cycle is ongoing. Once the internal write cycle has completed, the
              EEPROM will respond with an ACK, allowing a new read or write operation to be immediately initiated. A flowchart
              has been included below in Figure 7-3 to better illustrate this technique.

7.4 Write Cycle Timing

              The length of the self-timed write cycle (tWR) is defined as the amount of time from the Stop condition that begins the
              internal write cycle to the Start condition of the first device address byte sent to the AT24C128C/AT24C256C that it

7.5 Write Protection

              The AT24C128C/AT24C256C utilizes a hardware data protection scheme that allows the user to write-protect the
              entire memory array contents when the WP pin is at VCC (or a valid VIH). No write protection will be set if the WP pin
              is at GND or left floating.

                                             None － Write Protection Not Enabled

The status of the WP pin is sampled at the Stop condition for every byte write or page write operation prior to the start
of an internally self-timed write cycle. Changing the WP pin state after the Stop condition has been sent will not alter
or interrupt the execution of the write cycle.

If an attempt is made to write to the device while the WP pin has been asserted, the device will acknowledge the
device address, word address and data bytes, but no write cycle will occur when the Stop condition is issued. The
device will immediately be ready to accept a new read or write operation.

8. Read Operations

              Read operations are initiated the same way as write operations with the exception that the Read/Write Select bit in
              the device address byte must be a logic ‘1’. There are three read operations:

                • Current Address Read
                • Random Address Read
                • Sequential Read

8.1 Current Address Read

              The internal data word address counter maintains the last address accessed during the last read or write operation,
              incremented by one. This address stays valid between operations as long as the VCC is maintained to the part. The
              address rollover during a read is from the last byte of the last page to the first byte of the first page of the memory.

              A current address read operation will output data according to the location of the internal data word address counter.
              This is initiated with a Start condition, followed by a valid device address byte with the R/W bit set to logic ‘1’. The
              device will ACK this sequence and the current address data word is serially clocked out on the SDA line. All types of
              read operations will be terminated if the bus master does not respond with an ACK (it NACKs) during the ninth clock
              cycle. After the NACK response, the master may send a Stop condition to complete the protocol, or it can send a
              Start condition to begin the next sequence.

8.2 Random Read

              A random read begins in the same way as a byte write operation does to load in a new data word address. This is
              known as a “dummy write” sequence; however, the data byte and the Stop condition of the byte write must be omitted
              to prevent the part from entering an internal write cycle. Once the device address and word address are clocked in
              and acknowledged by the EEPROM, the bus master must generate another Start condition. The bus master now
              initiates a current address read by sending a Start condition, followed by a valid device address byte with the R/W bit
              set to logic ‘1’. The EEPROM will ACK the device address and serially clock out the data word on the SDA line. All
              types of read operations will be terminated if the bus master does not respond with an ACK (it NACKs) during the
              ninth clock cycle. After the NACK response, the master may send a Stop condition to complete the protocol, or it can
              send a Start condition to begin the next sequence.

8.3 Sequential Read

              Sequential reads are initiated by either a current address read or a random read. After the bus master receives a
              data word, it responds with an Acknowledge. As long as the EEPROM receives an ACK, it will continue to increment
              the word address and serially clock out sequential data words. When the maximum memory address is reached, the
              data word address will rollover and the sequential read will continue from the beginning of the memory array. All
              types of read operations will be terminated if the bus master does not respond with an ACK (it NACKs) during the
              ninth clock cycle. After the NACK response, the master may send a Stop condition to complete the protocol, or it can
              send a Start condition to begin the next sequence.

Microchip Devices Code Protection Feature

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
  • Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
  • Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today,
      when used in the intended manner and under normal conditions.

© 2020 Microchip Technology Inc.                          Datasheet                      DS20006270B-page 35

  • There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these
      methods, to our knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating
      specifications contained in Microchip’s Data Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of
      intellectual property.

  • Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
  • Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code

      protection does not mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”

Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection
features of our products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you
may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
