                 AT24C32/64

Pin Description  SERIAL CLOCK (SCL): The SCL input is used to positive edge clock data into each
                 EEPROM device and negative edge clock data out of each device.

                 SERIAL DATA (SDA): The SDA pin is bidirectional for serial data transfer. This pin is
                 open-drain driven and may be wire-ORed with any number of other open-drain or open
                 collector devices.

                 DEVICE/PAGE ADDRESSES (A2, A1, A0): The A2, A1 and A0 pins are device address
                 inputs that are hard wired or left not connected for hardware compatibility with
                 AT24C16. When the pins are hardwired, as many as eight 32K/64K devices may be
                 addressed on a single bus system (device addressing is discussed in detail under the
                 Device Addressing section). When the pins are not hardwired, the default A2, A1, and A0
                 are zero.

                 WRITE PROTECT (WP): The write protect input, when tied to GND, allows normal write
                 operations. When WP is tied high to VCC, all write operations to the upper quandrant
                 (8/16K bits) of memory are inhibited. If left unconnected, WP is internally pulled down to
                 GND.

Memory Organization AT24C32/64, 32K/64K SERIAL EEPROM: The 32K/64K is internally organized as 256

                                               pages of 32 bytes each. Random word addressing requires a 12/13 bit data word
                                               address.

                                                                                                                                                                    3

                  nal device. Data on the SDA pin may change only during SCL low time periods (refer to
                  Data Validity timing diagram). Data changes during SCL high periods will indicate a start
                  or stop condition as defined below.

                  START CONDITION: A high-to-low transition of SDA with SCL high is a start condition
                  which must precede any other command (refer to Start and Stop Definition timing
                  diagram).

                  STOP CONDITION: A low-to-high transition of SDA with SCL high is a stop condition.
                  After a read sequence, the stop command will place the EEPROM in a standby power
                  mode (refer to Start and Stop Definition timing diagram).

                  ACKNOWLEDGE: All addresses and data words are serially transmitted to and from the
                  EEPROM in 8-bit words. The EEPROM sends a zero during the ninth clock cycle to
                  acknowledge that it has received each word.

                  STANDBY MODE: The AT24C32/64 features a low power standby mode which is
                  enabled: a) upon power-up and b) after the receipt of the STOP bit and the completion
                  of any internal operations.

                  MEMORY RESET: After an interruption in protocol, power loss or system reset, any 2-
                  wire part can be reset by following these steps:

                  (a) Clock up to 9 cycles, (b) look for SDA high in each cycle while SCL is high and then
                  (c) create a start condition as SDA is high.

                   AT24C32/64

Device Addressing  The 32K/64K EEPROM requires an 8-bit device address word following a start condition
Write Operations   to enable the chip for a read or write operation (refer to Figure 1). The device address
                   word consists of a mandatory one, zero sequence for the first four most significant bits
                   as shown. This is common to all 2-wire EEPROM devices.

                   The 32K/64K uses the three device address bits A2, A1, A0 to allow as many as eight
                   devices on the same bus. These bits must compare to their corresponding hardwired
                   input pins. The A2, A1, and A0 pins use an internal proprietary circuit that biases them
                   to a logic low condition if the pins are allowed to float.

                   The eighth bit of the device address is the read/write operation select bit. A read opera-
                   tion is initiated if this bit is high and a write operation is initiated if this bit is low.

                   Upon a compare of the device address, the EEPROM will output a zero. If a compare is
                   not made, the device will return to standby state.

                   NOISE PROTECTION: Special internal circuitry placed on the SDA and SCL pins pre-
                   vent small noise spikes from activating the device. A low-VCC detector (5-volt option)
                   resets the device to prevent data corruption in a noisy environment.

                   DATA SECURITY: The AT24C32/64 has a hardware data protection scheme that allows
                   the user to write protect the upper quadrant (8/16K bits) of memory when the WP pin is
                   at VCC.

                   BYTE WRITE: A write operation requires two 8-bit data word addresses following the
                   device address word and acknowledgment. Upon receipt of this address, the EEPROM
                   will again respond with a zero and then clock in the first 8-bit data word. Following
                   receipt of the 8-bit data word, the EEPROM will output a zero and the addressing
                   device, such as a microcontroller, must terminate the write sequence with a stop condi-
                   tion. At this time the EEPROM enters an internally-timed write cycle, tWR, to the
                   nonvolatile memory. All inputs are disabled during this write cycle and the EEPROM will
                   not respond until the write is complete (refer to Figure 2).

                   PAGE WRITE: The 32K/64K EEPROM is capable of 32-byte page writes.

                   A page write is initiated the same way as a byte write, but the microcontroller does not
                   send a stop condition after the first data word is clocked in. Instead, after the EEPROM
                   acknowledges receipt of the first data word, the microcontroller can transmit up to 31
                   more data words. The EEPROM will respond with a zero after each data word received.
                   The microcontroller must terminate the page write sequence with a stop condition (refer
                   to Figure 3).

                   The data word address lower 5 bits are internally incremented following the receipt of
                   each data word. The higher data word address bits are not incremented, retaining the
                   memory page row location. When the word address, internally generated, reaches the
                   page boundary, the following byte is placed at the beginning of the same page. If more
                   than 32 data words are transmitted to the EEPROM, the data word address will “roll
                   over” and previous data will be overwritten.

                   ACKNOWLEDGE POLLING: Once the internally-timed write cycle has started and the
                   EEPROM inputs are disabled, acknowledge polling can be initiated. This involves send-
                   ing a start condition followed by the device address word. The read/write bit is
                   representative of the operation desired. Only if the internal write cycle has completed
                   will the EEPROM respond with a zero, allowing the read or write sequence to continue.

                                                                                                                                                                    9

0336K–SEEPR–7/03
Read        Read operations are initiated the same way as write operations with the exception that the
Operations  read/write select bit in the device address word is set to one. There are three read operations:
            current address read, random address read and sequential read.

            CURRENT ADDRESS READ: The internal data word address counter maintains the last
            address accessed during the last read or write operation, incremented by one. This address
            stays valid between operations as long as the chip power is maintained. The address “roll
            over” during read is from the last byte of the last memory page, to the first byte of the first
            page. The address “roll over” during write is from the last byte of the current page to the first
            byte of the same page.

            Once the device address with the read/write select bit set to one is clocked in and acknowl-
            edged by the EEPROM, the current address data word is serially clocked out. The
            microcontroller does not respond with an input zero but does generate a following stop condi-
            tion (refer to Figure 4).

            RANDOM READ: A random read requires a “dummy” byte write sequence to load in the data
            word address. Once the device address word and data word address are clocked in and
            acknowledged by the EEPROM, the microcontroller must generate another start condition.
            The microcontroller now initiates a current address read by sending a device address with the
            read/write select bit high. The EEPROM acknowledges the device address and serially clocks
            out the data word. The microcontroller does not respond with a zero but does generate a fol-
            lowing stop condition (refer to Figure 5).

            SEQUENTIAL READ: Sequential reads are initiated by either a current address read or a ran-
            dom address read. After the microcontroller receives a data word, it responds with an
            acknowledge. As long as the EEPROM receives an acknowledge, it will continue to increment
            the data word address and serially clock out sequential data words. When the memory
            address limit is reached, the data word address will “roll over” and the sequential read will con-
            tinue. The sequential read operation is terminated when the microcontroller does not respond
            with a zero but does generate a following stop condition (refer to Figure 6).
